# This is a placeholder for the notification chime sound file.
# Replace this file with an actual MP3 audio file for the notification sound.
# The file should be a short chime or beep sound (1-2 seconds).
# 
# You can:
# 1. Download a free notification sound from freesound.org
# 2. Record your own chime sound
# 3. Use a text-to-speech service to generate a simple beep
# 4. Use the fallback audio generation in the NotificationContext (already implemented)
